# Playwright End-to-End Automation Framework (JavaScript)

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my **learning and hands-on implementation of Playwright automation testing**, based on a comprehensive Udemy course covering **UI automation, API testing, frameworks, and advanced Playwright capabilities**.

The project demonstrates how to build **robust, scalable, and modern end-to-end test automation solutions** using **Playwright with JavaScript**, following industry best practices.


---

## 🎯 Course Focus

This course (and therefore this repository) is **entirely practical**.  
All automation is performed against a **fully functional e-commerce application**, covering real-world scenarios commonly seen in modern **React and Angular applications**.

The goal is to become confident in **full end-to-end automation**, combining:
- UI testing
- API testing
- Framework design
- CI/CD integration

## 🛠️ What This Repository Covers

### ✅ Playwright Web / UI Automation (≈50%)
- Core Playwright concepts
- UI automation for modern web applications
- Handling dynamic components
- Robust locator strategies
- Assertions and validations

### ✅ Mixed UI & API Testing (≈25%)
- API testing using Playwright
- Creating test data via APIs
- End-to-end scenarios combining API + UI in a single flow
- Network mocking and interception

### ✅ Advanced Playwright Framework Features (≈25%)
- Page Object Model (POM)
- External test data handling
- Custom utility methods
- HTML reporting
- Session handling using API cookies (bypassing UI login)
- Optimizing execution speed and stability

---

## 🧱 Frameworks Implemented

This repository demonstrates **two industry-grade test frameworks**, both built using Page Object design patterns:

### 🔹 Playwright with Cucumber (BDD)
- Feature files written in Gherkin
- Step definitions in JavaScript
- Clean separation of test intent and implementation

### 🔹 Playwright with Mocha
- Structured test suites
- Hooks and lifecycle management
- Flexible test execution

## 📊 Reporting & Debugging Capabilities

Playwright provides powerful built-in debugging tools, all demonstrated in this project:

- 📸 Screenshots
- 🎥 Video recordings
- 🕵️ Playwright Inspector
- 🧵 Playwright Traces for post-execution analysis
- 📄 Custom HTML reports

---

## 🚀 CI/CD & Containers

The framework is designed to be **CI/CD ready**:

- Jenkins integration
- Dockerized test execution
- Scalable and repeatable test runs

---

## 🧑‍💻 Language & Prerequisites

- **Language:** JavaScript (Playwright JS binding)
- **No prior JavaScript experience required**

For beginners, the course includes:
- **3 hours of JavaScript fundamentals**
- Coding assignments and quizzes
- Interview preparation basics

This repository assumes JavaScript is learned progressively alongside Playwright.
